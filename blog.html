                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
                <p>There are various kinds of certificates available: 
                    from undergraduate to graduate and advanced certificates. Certificates serve a multitude of purposes for different students: 
                    they are sometimes used to bridge the gap between different phases of academic study, or to provide additional professional training and qualifications. 
                    There are certificates in a wide variety of subjects in Arts, Humanities, Business, Biological and Life Sciences, Engineering, Technology, Natural Sciences
                    and even more. The variety of different certificates can be overwhelming - don't let it stop you! Start your search by looking at the most popular certificates listed below
                    .</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In Australia, a certificate is a qualification offered by a university or other higher education provider which is shorter than a degree or diploma. 
                        Certificates are generally provided by TAFE colleges or non-academic registered training organizations (often workplaces). There are four ranks of certificate in Australia, indicated by Roman numerals, 
                        e.g., Cert. IV in Horticulture. The time spent varies, but in general a Certificate I will be granted after a course of only a few weeks, while a Cert. IV may take up to twelve months. A Diploma directly follows Cert. 
                        IV and may rightly be considered equivalent to a hypothetical Certificate V.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>In the United States, a certificate may be offered by an institute of higher education. These certificates usually signify that a student has reached a standard of knowledge about a certain vocational or professional subject. 
                        Certificate programs can be completed more quickly than associate degrees and often do not have general education requirements. Undergraduate certificates represent completion of a specific program offered in coordination with a bachelor's degree.
                         Graduate certificates represent completion of studies beyond the bachelor's degree, yet short of a masters degree.</p>    
                         <br>
                    <p>It also may be awarded as a necessary certification to validate that a student is considered competent in a certain specific networking skill area in information technology. Thus a computer engineer or computer science graduation most likely 
                        will have to obtain additional certificates on and pertaining to the specific technologies or equipment used by the hiring corporation; if not, such employer may suffer unwanted penalties like forgoing (voiding the contract)
                         the protections of a certain level of customer service or warranties.</p>
